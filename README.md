# SoilReconProps
Documentation of project recreating soil property maps from conventional soil survey using predictive soil mapping techniques for the Upper Colorado River Basin (UCRB). Project is in Beta status with peer review pending.

Repository for article: Nauman, T.W, Duniway, M.C.. In Preparation. Predictive reconstruction of soil survey property maps for field scale adaptive land management. For submission to: Soil Science Society of America Journal.

This repository documents code and data inputs used to create new soil property maps of the Upper Colorado River Basin (UCRB) using past soil survey field observations to recreate maps of specific soil properties at standard depths (0, 5, 15, 30, 60, 100, and 200 cm). Files are organized by soil property except materials that summarize all models.
